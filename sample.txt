This is a simple online tool that converts regular text into text symbols which resemble the normal alphabet letters. It converts text into several symbol sets which are listed in the second text area, and the conversion is done in real-time and in your browser using JavaScript. If you'd like your text to be randomly translated into different symbol (character by character), check out my other translator called "fancy text".

You'd be forgiven for thinking that this translator converts text into a number of different fonts - that's not what's happening here. So how does it work? Unicode.
